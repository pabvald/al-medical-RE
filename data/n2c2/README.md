# N2C2 Corpus

The N2C2 corpus was obtained from the Data and Computing Resources of the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at the Blavatnik Institute of Harvard Medical School [(https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/)](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/).

Unfortunately, due to legal restrictions, the dataset cannot be included in this repository. To access the dataset, you must first register on the DBMI portal and fill out a form.

Once you have obtained the dataset, move the `train` and `test` folders containing the `.txt` and `.ann` files to this directory.
