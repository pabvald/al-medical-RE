# Machine Learning Methods

This directory contains the code for the Random Forest and BiLSTM methods. 

## Random Forest
The Random Forest method is based on [scikit-learn's implementation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html). 


## BiLSTM
The BiLSTM method has been implemented using the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) library using some already-implemented modules from the [Joey NMT](https://github.com/joeynmt/joeynmt) library.


## Clinical BERT & Paired Clinical BERT
We use the [Transformers BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert) implementation for the BERT-based methods.
